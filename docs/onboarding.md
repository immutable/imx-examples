# Onboarding (Self-service)

To begin, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples.git

cd imx-examples
```

Copy environment file

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the onboarding private key in `.env`. Your private key will be used to create a signed payload only and will not be sent to our backend services.

```sh
OWNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## 1. Register as a user with Immutable X

We provide an authentication service to protect your administrative level assets from being accessed or updated by someone else. This is done using a simliar technique as described [here](https://link.medium.com/CVTcj7YfQkb).

In order to use services like creating a project or collection, you will first need to register as an Immutable X user. This is done by setting up an account using the private key from the wallet account you would like to specify as the owner of the project.

Run the following script:

_Requires environment variables `OWNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` to be set._

```sh
npm run onboarding:user-registration
```

## 2. Create project

Update the values in file `2-create-project.ts` with the values of the project you want to create.

- `name` - _The name of the project_
- `company_name` - _The name of the company_
- `contact_email` - _Your associated company email_

Once updated, run the following script to create your project:

_Requires environment variables `OWNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` to be set._

```sh
npm run onboarding:create-project
```

On completion, the script will log the ID of the created project. Save this ID for use in the next step.

## 3. Add a collection

A collection refers to a smart contract you have deployed. Minted assets belong to a collection. In order to mint assets on L2
you must first register your collection (smart contract) with Immutable X.

Add the collection contract address to the environment variable `COLLECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

Set `COLLECTION_PROJECT_ID` to the project ID you created with `create-project` step

Once updated, run the following script to create your collection:

_Requires environment variables `OWNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `COLLECTION_PROJECT_ID` and `COLLECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to be set._

```sh
npm run onboarding:create-collection
```
If you see a `replacement transaction underpriced` error message when trying to run `create-collection` please try again in 5 minutes.

## 4. Add metadata schema to your collection

Update the values in file `4-add-metadata-schema.ts` with the values of the metadata you want to define.

Once updated, run the following script to create your collection:

_Requires environment variables `OWNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `COLLECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to be set._

```sh
npm run onboarding:add-metadata-schema
```
